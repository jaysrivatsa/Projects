# Image Classifier
The objective of this project was to get a glance at the power of neral networks. In this project the library tensorflow was used to build a neural network. Kearas layers was used to build multiple layers of the neural network.
## Preprocessing
1. This project is an example of supervised learning. A data set already bulit into the library tensorflow was taken.
2. The datasete was divided into training data set and testing data set.
## Building Neural Network
1. Kearas sequential layer was used to build a neural network.
