### 1. Support 
   The first measure called the support is the number of transactions that include items in the {A} and {B} parts of the rule as a  percentage of the total number of transactions.
   The support of the rule A\rightarrow B is given by the following probability:
P(A\cap B)=\frac{800}{100000}= 0.8%
