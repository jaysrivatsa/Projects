# Market Basket Analysis
Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of items. It is a data mining technique that discovers co-occurrence relationships among activities performed by specific individuals or groups.

## Glossary
### 1. Antecedent
Anything that happens before. If a rule is A -> B then A is the antecedent.
### 2.Consequent 
Anything that happens after is know as Consequent. In a rule A -> B then B is the consequent.
### 3. Support 
The first measure called the support is the number of transactions that include items in the {A} and {B} parts of the rule as a  percentage of the total number of transactions.
   
support(A and B) = number(A and B)/ total number of observations
### 4. Confidence
Confidence is the number of time B has happened given A has happend.

Confidence(A -> B) = number(B)/number(A)
