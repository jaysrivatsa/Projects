### 1. Support 
   The first measure called the support is the number of transactions that include items in the {A} and {B} parts of the rule as a  percentage of the total number of transactions.
   support(A and B) = number of times A and B happens/ total number of observations
### 2. Confidence
    The number of time event B has occured given that A has occured.
    Confidence = number(B|A)/number(A)
